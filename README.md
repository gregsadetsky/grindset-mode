# Grindset Mode

Are people emailing you while you are grinding? Are you trying to focus on your work but keep getting distracted by emails? 

<b>Grindset Mode</b> is here to help you. Whenever your inbox has more than 100 unread emails, if anyone tries to email you, they will get an automated reply telling them that you are in Grindset Mode and that your mailbox is full.
